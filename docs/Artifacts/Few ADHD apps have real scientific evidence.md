# Few ADHD apps have real scientific evidence—here's what actually works

**The uncomfortable truth: of the hundreds of ADHD apps available, only three have FDA clearance and fewer than five have meaningful peer-reviewed research.** Most "science-backed" apps on the market have never been studied in clinical trials. The apps with genuine evidence primarily improve attention on lab tests, but transfer to real-world symptoms remains questionable. Professional organizations including CHADD and the American Academy of Pediatrics emphasize that medication and behavioral therapy remain the only interventions with solid research evidence—digital tools are adjuncts, not replacements.

## FDA-cleared digital therapeutics represent the strongest evidence tier

Three apps have achieved FDA clearance specifically for ADHD, all demonstrating statistically significant improvements in attention as measured by the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA):

**EndeavorRx** (Akili Interactive) became the first FDA-authorized prescription video game treatment for ADHD in June 2020. The pivotal STARS-ADHD trial published in *The Lancet Digital Health* randomized **348 children ages 8-12** to either EndeavorRx or a control video game. Treatment involved 25 minutes daily for 4 weeks. Results showed statistically significant attention improvement versus control (p=0.006), with **47%** of treated children showing meaningful TOVA improvement versus **32%** in controls. The FDA expanded authorization to ages 8-17 in December 2023 based on additional data from **162 adolescents**. Parent-reported outcomes showed 68% noting improvement in ADHD-related impairments after two months. The app requires a prescription and costs approximately **$450 for 90 days**. Available on iOS and Android tablets.

**EndeavorOTC** launched in June 2024 as the first over-the-counter FDA-cleared digital therapeutic for adult ADHD. A study of **221 adults** using the app for 6 weeks found **83%** reported improved focus and **72.5%** reported quality of life improvement, with **45.8%** meeting thresholds for clinically meaningful improvement on standardized measures. Unlike the prescription version, EndeavorOTC costs **$24.99/month or $129.99/year** and is available without prescription on iOS and Android.

**LumosityRx (Prismira)** received FDA clearance in December 2025 following the GAMES study—a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial across 13 clinical sites with over **500 participants**. Adults ages 22-55 showed significantly greater improvement in sustained and selective attention versus control, with **44.2%** achieving clinically meaningful attention gains. The app features 13 cognitive training games and requires a prescription; pricing has not been announced.

## Critical limitation: lab test improvements don't equal real-world benefits

A crucial distinction emerges from examining FDA documentation and systematic reviews. All three FDA-cleared apps demonstrate improvement on TOVA scores—a computerized attention test—but the FDA labeling explicitly states that patients **"may not display benefits in typical behavioral symptoms, such as hyperactivity."** This is not a minor caveat.

The EndeavorRx pivotal trial found **no significant difference** between treatment and control groups on the ADHD Rating Scale or Clinical Global Impressions scale—the tools clinicians actually use to assess ADHD. Parent assessments similarly showed no group differences. As CHADD (the CDC's National Resource Center on ADHD) states: "Most ADHD computer games can only show that they improve the child's ability to do well on lab tests for the skills on which they were trained. **There is very little evidence that the skills make a difference in real life**, like in school or at home."

Additionally, all FDA-cleared apps are indicated for use "as part of a therapeutic program"—explicitly not standalone treatments or substitutes for medication. Studies excluded children taking ADHD medication and those with psychiatric comorbidities, limiting generalizability.

## CBT-based apps show promise but evidence remains preliminary

**Inflow** represents the most rigorously studied consumer CBT app for adult ADHD. Developed based on established CBT protocols for ADHD (particularly Safren's model), it underwent a 7-week open feasibility study published in *PLOS Digital Health* with **240 adults** recruited online. Results showed medium effect sizes on overall ADHD symptoms (d = -0.71), large effects on inattentive symptoms (d = -1.0), and significant decreases in functional impairment. The app addresses focus, organization, time management, emotional regulation, and anxiety through structured psychoeducation and CBT techniques. Available on iOS and Android, it costs **$22-48/month** with coaching options and offers financial assistance. The limitation: this was an open-label study (not a randomized controlled trial), involved company founders as researchers, and had high dropout—only 93 of 240 participants completed efficacy analyses.

**Cogmed Working Memory Training** has the most extensive research history, with over seven randomized controlled trials since development at the Karolinska Institute. However, findings are mixed enough that it's classified as only "possibly efficacious" by the Society for Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology. A 2023 meta-analysis by the European ADHD Guidelines Group concluded effects were limited to "small, setting-specific, short-term effects on attention symptoms." Replication attempts by Georgia Tech and Case Western Reserve found insufficient evidence for manufacturer claims. Importantly, Cogmed improves performance on trained working memory tasks but shows limited transfer to real-world ADHD symptoms. It costs **$1,000-2,500** through qualified providers and is computer-based rather than a mobile app.

**Todaki**, a CBT chatbot developed by Yonsei University College of Medicine, showed promise in a small randomized pilot study of **46 adults** over 4 weeks. Chatbot users showed greater reductions in hyperactive-impulsive and overall symptoms versus a self-help book control. However, participants were not specifically diagnosed with ADHD, limiting conclusions.

## What systematic reviews reveal about ADHD digital interventions

A 2024 meta-analysis of **25 randomized controlled trials** examining digital ADHD interventions found statistically significant but modest effects: a standardized mean difference of **-0.33** for overall symptoms and **-0.31** for inattention specifically. Effects on hyperactivity/impulsivity were minimal (SMD = -0.15).

However, a 2025 systematic review of reviews in *BMC Psychiatry* examining 26 reviews covering **34,442 participants** delivered a sobering assessment: only **3 of 26 reviews were classified as high quality** using AMSTAR-2 methodology standards. The review concluded that "effectiveness remains inconclusive due to low evidence quality." High-quality evidence specifically showed **no effect on hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms**—only small improvement in inattention.

Perhaps most concerning: only **8 of 26 reviews (30%)** reported adverse effects at all, suggesting significant underreporting of safety data.

## Most commercial apps lack any scientific evidence

A foundational 2020 systematic review examined **109 ADHD apps** available in app stores and found that **none contained information regarding evidence for their efficacy or effectiveness**. There was zero overlap between apps with peer-reviewed evidence and those commercially available on the market.

Popular apps including **Numo**, **Done**, and **Focusmate** claim to be "science-backed" or employ evidence-based methods, but have no peer-reviewed publications demonstrating their effectiveness for ADHD. Numo claims an internal study with 86 participants but nothing published in scientific journals. Done focuses on telehealth ADHD diagnosis and medication but has raised concerns about overprescribing rather than app-based treatment evidence.

A 2025 scoping review of commercial ADHD apps found only **2 of 35 apps received any medical endorsement**, while 27% promoted unvalidated "cognitive treatment" approaches.

## Apps organized by evidence quality and symptom target

**Highest evidence (FDA-cleared, multiple clinical studies):**
- EndeavorRx — attention function in children 8-17; requires prescription; iOS/Android
- EndeavorOTC — attention function in adults 18+; OTC; $25/month; iOS/Android  
- LumosityRx — attention function in adults 22-55; requires prescription; iOS/Android

**Moderate evidence (peer-reviewed research, not RCT-validated):**
- Inflow — CBT for adults; focus, organization, emotional regulation; $22-48/month; iOS/Android
- Cogmed — working memory training; children and adults; $1,000-2,500; computer-based

**Preliminary evidence (small studies only):**
- Todaki — CBT chatbot for adults; overall symptoms; research prototype
- FOCUS ADHD App — medication adherence; adults; research study by Brazilian university
- Headspace — general mindfulness with one small ADHD pilot study (18 children)

**No peer-reviewed evidence despite marketing claims:**
- Numo, Done, Focusmate, and most commercial ADHD apps

## Expert consensus: apps complement but don't replace treatment

Professional organizations maintain consistent guidance. CHADD emphasizes that **medication and behavioral treatments remain the only interventions with "solid research evidence"** for ADHD. The American Academy of Pediatrics' 2019 Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend medication and behavioral therapy as first-line treatments with no specific endorsement of digital tools. Digital interventions are categorized as "complementary approaches" only.

Clinicians interviewed in research studies expressed skepticism. Representative comments include: "It's difficult through an app to build a child's kind of confidence" and "They are trying to just say that going on an app makes you less impulsive and reduces your hyperactivity which I very very much doubt."

The FDA clearance pathway itself merits context. These apps received Class II medical device clearance—the same category as pregnancy tests—which does not require the same rigorous evidence standards as pharmaceutical approval. Clearance demonstrates safety and some efficacy but is not equivalent to FDA drug approval.

## Who might benefit versus who should be cautious

Apps may be appropriate as supplements (not replacements) for individuals already receiving established treatment who want additional organizational support, adults with primarily inattentive presentation seeking structured CBT-based tools, and families who have tried traditional treatments and want complementary resources.

Apps are **not recommended** as standalone ADHD treatment, for replacing proper clinical diagnosis and medical management, for those seeking hyperactivity or impulsivity help (evidence is lacking for these symptoms), or for individuals who have not first received appropriate clinical evaluation.

Specific contraindications for EndeavorRx include photosensitive epilepsy, color blindness affecting red-green perception, and low frustration tolerance. Research also suggests ADHD patients face higher video game addiction risk, and some studies found worsening symptoms when screen time exceeded one hour daily.

## Privacy and quality concerns in the app marketplace

Beyond efficacy questions, mental health apps raise data security concerns. A study of 27 mental health apps found unnecessary permissions, insecure cryptography, leaks of personal data in logs, and data sharing with third-party advertisers. A depression app review found only **49% had any privacy policy** and 68% received "unacceptable" transparency scores. The UK's NHS Apps Library was discontinued within a week after reviews revealed many apps lacked evidence and had unsuitable data security.

## Conclusion

The evidence landscape for ADHD apps reveals a stark gap between marketing and science. Only three apps have FDA clearance, and their demonstrated benefits are largely confined to lab-based attention tests rather than the real-world symptom improvements that matter to patients and families. The CBT-based app Inflow shows the most promise for adults seeking structured behavioral support, but still lacks randomized controlled trial validation.

The key insight is that **improved attention on a computerized test does not necessarily translate to better functioning at work, school, or home**—the outcomes that actually matter. Until research demonstrates durable real-world benefits, professional consensus holds that medication and behavioral therapy remain first-line treatments, with apps serving as potential adjuncts for motivated individuals already engaged in evidence-based care.

For those considering ADHD apps: FDA-cleared options like EndeavorOTC (adults) or prescription EndeavorRx (children) have the strongest evidence base, though with important limitations. Inflow offers structured CBT for adults at reasonable cost. Most other apps in app stores have zero scientific evidence supporting their claims, regardless of marketing language.
