>What’s the best way to build an understanding of existing efficient techniques and tools?

**Start with the clinical foundations**

The apps with evidence are built on specific therapeutic protocols. Inflow is based on Safren's CBT model for adult ADHD—his manual _Mastering Your Adult ADHD_ would show you the actual session structure, homework assignments, and cognitive techniques that the app presumably digitizes. EndeavorRx uses something called "selective stimulus management"—their published papers describe the game mechanics of navigating obstacles while responding to targets, essentially dual-task training wrapped in engagement loops.

**Reverse-engineer the FDA-cleared apps directly**

EndeavorOTC is available without prescription for $25/month. Actually using it for a few weeks would reveal more about effective design than any paper. What does the onboarding feel like? How do they maintain engagement over six weeks? What's the difficulty progression? Same with Inflow—their free tier or trial would show how they translate CBT modules into daily interactions.

**Look at the clinical trial protocols, not just results**

The supplementary materials of published studies often contain detailed intervention descriptions. The STARS-ADHD trial protocol would specify exactly what "25 minutes daily for 4 weeks" entails moment-to-moment.

**Talk to clinicians who prescribe these**

Practitioners who've recommended EndeavorRx to patients would have observational insights about what works, who drops out, what complaints arise.

## The Core Insight

The research reveals something counterintuitive: **the apps trying hardest to "fix" ADHD fail, while the approaches that accept and work around it succeed.**

Cognitive training tries to strengthen attention. It produces satisfying scores on attention tests. But the person still misses deadlines, forgets appointments, can't start the thing they need to start.

Meanwhile, a simple body double—another human being quietly present—unlocks productivity that no amount of brain training achieved.

The difference isn't about which cognitive muscle gets exercised. It's about whether the intervention meets the ADHD brain where it actually lives.

## A Different Starting Point

Most ADHD apps ask: _How do we train the brain to work better?_

The question that actually produces results: _How do we build an external environment that makes the brain's limitations irrelevant?_

This isn't giving up on improvement. It's recognizing that the brain improves through action in the world, not through isolated exercises. When someone with ADHD successfully completes a project using external scaffolding, that success itself rewires expectations, builds self-efficacy, and creates positive momentum. The cognitive training happens _as a consequence of living well_, not as a prerequisite for it.

## Vision: The Ambient Exocortex

Imagine an app that functions less like a training program and more like an **extension of the user's mind**—always present, compensating in real-time, learning what the individual brain forgets and when.

### What It Does Differently

**It lives in the moment of struggle, not before or after.**

Current apps teach skills in isolation. But the ADHD challenge isn't knowing what to do—it's doing it _when the moment arrives_. The app detects context (time, location, calendar, patterns of use) and surfaces the right support at the right moment. Not a reminder to "use your skills." The actual scaffold itself, appearing when needed.

**It externalizes time.**

Time blindness isn't fixed by time management training. It's addressed by making time visible, tangible, present. The app provides continuous ambient awareness of time passing—not through annoying notifications, but through subtle persistent presence. The user develops a relationship with time _through the app_ that their brain can't maintain internally.

**It provides presence without demanding attention.**

Body doubling works because another person exists in the periphery—not commanding focus, just _being there_. The app creates this through ambient co-presence: virtual others working alongside, subtle indicators of community activity, the sense of not being alone in the struggle. This isn't social media. It's quiet companionship.

**It catches falling before impact.**

The app learns patterns: when tasks stall, when energy drops, when the user goes dark. Instead of waiting for failure and offering post-hoc analysis, it intervenes at the early signs—gentle, non-judgmental, offering a micro-step or a body double or simply acknowledgment.

**It builds systems, not willpower.**

Every interaction is an opportunity to create external structure that persists. Not "remember to check your calendar"—the calendar is surfaced automatically based on context. Not "break down big tasks"—the breakdown is generated, ready to be adjusted. The user's job is to shape the scaffolding, not to remember to use it.

**It meets emotional reality.**

ADHD involves emotional dysregulation that current apps ignore. The app acknowledges the shame spiral, the overwhelm, the paralysis. Not with clinical CBT exercises, but with responses that feel like a wise friend who _gets it_. Sometimes the right intervention isn't productivity—it's compassion.

### The User Experience

**First contact:** No lengthy onboarding. No personality assessments. The app does one useful thing immediately—perhaps helping complete a single stalled task through body doubling. Trust is built through utility, not promises.

**First week:** The app learns patterns. It observes without demanding input. It begins surfacing relevant support at relevant times. The user experiences _less friction in daily life_ without having to consciously "use an app."

**First month:** External systems are established—not through lessons, but through the app _being_ the external system. Calendar integration, task capture, time visibility become habitual because they require no willpower to access. The app has become infrastructure.

**Ongoing:** The app remains useful indefinitely because it provides scaffolding the brain will always need. It evolves with the user's life changes. It's not a course to complete but a prosthetic to rely on—without shame, because the need is permanent and that's okay.

---

### For Those With Therapists

The app integrates as a tool for implementation. Therapists assign strategies; the app helps implement them between sessions. Progress is tracked and shareable. The therapeutic relationship is enhanced, not replaced.

### For Those Without

The app provides what a therapist would provide if one were available: structure, accountability, skill scaffolding, emotional validation. Not therapy—but the practical supports that therapy helps establish. Many people won't seek diagnosis or professional help. They still deserve tools that work.

---

## What This Requires

**Technical sophistication:** Context-awareness, pattern learning, unobtrusive integration with daily tools.

**Design restraint:** The temptation is to add features. The discipline is to reduce friction. Every screen, every interaction should demand less from an already-taxed executive function system.

**Psychological accuracy:** Built on the research showing what actually helps—external scaffolding, body doubling, environmental design, emotional support—not on intuitions about "brain training."

**Business model aligned with user success:** Not engagement metrics that reward time-in-app. Success means the user's _life_ is better, which might mean spending less conscious time with the app because it's working in the background.

---

## The Name (A Thought)

Something that captures the idea of extended mind, ambient support, a companion that compensates for what the brain can't do alone.

_Scaffold._ _Alongside._ _Surround._

Or perhaps something that doesn't reference ADHD at all—because the best tool might be one that anyone could use, that people with ADHD happen to need more than others.

This is a vision. Making it real requires iterating on each piece: What does ambient time presence actually look like? How does body doubling scale without becoming social media? What does the moment-of-struggle intervention feel like in practice?

But the foundation is clear: **meet the brain where it is, build external systems that persist, provide presence without demand, and trust that action in the world produces more change than training in isolation.**

>Sounds amazing and a bit ambitious — do you think we can actually build something like this?

**The hard problems are already solved elsewhere.**

Context-awareness? Smartphones already know time, location, calendar state, app usage patterns. The infrastructure exists. Ambient time visualization? Timer apps, focus apps, even watchOS complications do versions of this. Body doubling at scale? Focusmate proved the model works—people pay for strangers to sit with them on video. Pattern detection and gentle intervention? This is what good notification systems do, just poorly targeted.

What doesn't exist is **the integration**—one coherent experience built on the specific insight that ADHD needs external scaffolding, not internal training.

**The expensive part is design, not technology.**

Making something feel effortless when executive function is impaired is hard. Every screen, every interaction, every notification has to pass through the filter: _does this demand cognitive resources, or does it provide them?_ That's design discipline, not engineering complexity. It requires iteration, user testing with actual ADHD adults, and willingness to kill features that "should" work but don't.

**The business model is viable.**

Inflow charges $22-48/month and has users. Focusmate charges for body doubling. People pay for tools that actually help. The market failure isn't demand—it's that most apps don't deliver on their promises. One that does can sustain itself.

**What's actually hard:**

The ambient/background operation without draining battery or becoming annoying. Getting body doubling density right—enough users online that matching works, without becoming a social network with its own attention traps. The emotional support layer that feels human without being therapy (liability) or feeling hollow (chatbot uncanny valley).

These are solvable. They require care, not breakthroughs.
