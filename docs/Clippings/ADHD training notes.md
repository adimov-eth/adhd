**Information about ADHD**

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a real existing medical psychiatric disorder. It is believed that ADHD begins in childhood, however, many people with ADHD retain symptoms of the disorder into adulthood.

People with ADHD have three main types of symptoms:

1. Poor attention
2. High impulsivity
3. High activity (hyperactivity)

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 001

**ADHD Symptoms**

| Hyperactivity Symptoms ("Disinhibition") | Impulsivity Symptoms | Inattention Symptoms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| • Feeling like a motor is driving you      • Restlessness | • Often interrupting others      • Answering a question before it is fully asked | • Easily distracted      • Difficult to organize life      • Quickly becoming bored |
| • Hard to sit still | • "Blurting out" inappropriate comments | • Difficult to switch from one task to another |
| • Always rushing somewhere | • Impatience | • Difficult to plan and stick to a plan |
|  | • Acting before thinking | • Difficult to concentrate |
|  | • Doing something you later regret | • Unable to perform boring or unpleasant tasks |
|  | • Hard to wait |  |

Some people with ADHD have at least a few symptoms from all groups; others have symptoms predominantly from one category. The term "Attention Deficit Disorder" (ADD) is used when a person has symptoms of impaired attention but no symptoms of hyperactivity.

ADHD is not related to intelligence or laziness. ADHD is a problem that you can learn to cope with.

**How do we distinguish ADHD as a diagnosis from ordinary distractibility?**Some of the listed symptoms sound like they could apply to almost anyone at some time. For example, most people would say they are sometimes easily distracted or sometimes have organizational problems. This is the case with many mental disorders. That is why Criteria C and D exist.

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 002

---

For ADHD to be considered a medical diagnosis, a person must have significant difficulties in certain aspects of their life, such as work, significant relationship problems, and/or significant study problems. These two criteria define the problem as significantly bothering the person and substantially interfering with some aspect of their life.

- **"Significant distress"** means the problem causes emotional upset or negative experiences.
- **"Significantly interferes"** means the problem is somehow destructive in the person's life, for example, at work, at school, or in relationships.

**Medications and Psychotherapy.**Abroad, medications (stimulants or antidepressants) are prescribed for ADHD. Some of these drugs are banned in Russia, some are rarely used (e.g., antidepressants), and some patients turn out to be unresponsive to medications (from 20 to 50%). If you have the opportunity to be examined by a psychiatrist and receive a prescription for drugs, this will likely benefit you.

However, psychotherapy is also needed for ADHD because medications do not help patients master specific strategies and skills. Furthermore, impairments in general quality of life—underachievement, unemployment or underemployment, economic problems, and relationship difficulties associated with adult ADHD—require additional measures to improve the situation.

**Several different types of psychotherapy and support are recommended for ADHD:**

- **Environmental modification assistance:** finding suitable work, consulting the social circle, changing lifestyle rhythm, etc.
- **Psychotherapy to solve problems caused by ADHD:** depression, anxiety disorders, interpersonal relationship breakdown, etc.
- **Support in maintaining physical well-being:** physical activity, rational nutrition, etc.
- **Interpersonal communication training:** indicated for those with ADHD who have communication difficulties (especially useful for children).
- **Planning and distraction reduction skills training:** the training you are about to undergo.

This is just one option for help with ADHD and does not negate other options for receiving psychological help.

### Cognitive-Behavioral Model of ADHD

**(Interaction of factors):**

1. **Core Neurophysiological Deficits in:**
	- Attention
	- Inhibition
	- Self-regulation (impulsivity)
	- Emotional dysregulation
	- *(Influences)* ->
2. **Lack of Adequate Coping Strategies:**
	- Organization
	- Planning
	- Management of procrastination, distractibility, avoidance
	- *(Influences)* ->
3. **Personal History:**
	- Failures
	- Underachievement
	- Relationship problems
	- *(Influences)* -> **Negative Thoughts and Beliefs** and **Mood Disturbances**.
4. **Negative Thoughts and Beliefs:**
	- For example, negative self-image, low self-esteem
	- *(Influences)* -> **Mood Disturbances**.
5. **Mood Disturbances:**
	- Depression
	- Guilt
	- Anxiety
	- Anger
	- *(Influences)* -> **Functional Impairment** and **Lack of Strategies**.
6. **Functional Impairment**
	- *(Influences)* -> **Negative Thoughts and Beliefs** and **Mood Disturbances**.

In our course, we will focus on developing effective coping strategies, which in the long term affects all subsequent links in this chain.

### Defining Individual Training Goals

**Goal Scheme:**

- **Step** (Within a week)
- **Short-term Goal** (1-3 weeks)
- **Long-term Goal** (1-3 months)
- **Dream** (More than three months, for the first time)

**Dream** — bigger than a goal. Plans that will take more than 3 months to complete and which you have never achieved before. For example, "emigrate to Canada" or "Write a thesis" (if doing it for the first time), or "change career field." It is important to remember dreams to maintain direction, but focusing on them is detrimental to efficiency.

**Long-term Goal** — an intermediate plan taking 1 to 3 months. Maybe more, but only if you have done it before (otherwise it is a dream). For example, for the dream "change career field," an intermediate goal might be "complete graphic design courses."

**Short-term Goal** — an intermediate goal that takes less than one month to achieve. For example, "enroll in a graphic design course and start studying." These goals are most measurable and easier to control. For working on this course, it is best to choose long-term or short-term goals.

**Step** — a specific action doable in one sitting. That is, a step should fit into your normal day. For the goal "start studying at a graphic design course," the first step might be "browse the internet for graphic design course offers and make a list of them."

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 005

---

**Realistic therapy goals are things you can control.**For example, your long-term (or medium-term) goal is to get a job (or a better job than now). This is a serious, large-scale goal, and the skills we will learn will help you increase your chances of getting a better job. However, this big result depends on many other factors that you do not directly control (e.g., the state of the economy and the availability of jobs you want). Therefore, a realistic goal is to figure out what steps are necessary to improve the chances of finding a better job, and act according to these steps.

Likely, there are areas related to ADHD that also prevent you from getting a better job. This could be building an effective job search process, improving organizational skills at work, increasing productivity. The course can help with these problems because you can directly control them.

**Homework**

- Read the handout material for the first session.
- Make a list of individual training goals (long-term and short-term).
- **Optional:** Fill out the "Impact of ADHD Symptoms on Life Areas" sheet for all areas.
	- Do not hesitate to replace unimportant areas with important ones (for example, you can replace the "parenting" area with "spirituality," etc.).

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 006

## SESSION 2

### BASICS OF ORGANIZATION AND PLANNING

**Skill: Using a Calendar and To-Do List**

Organizing and setting up a calendar and a to-do list is the foundation of being organized. It is absolutely necessary. There are other things necessary for organization, but this is the most important. We consider this akin to eating. To be healthy, one must eat on time and adequately. However, there are many other things one must do to maintain health: go to doctors, take medicine, move, etc. Nutrition is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for health.

1. **The To-Do List** should include information you need that is not tied to a specific date. It will include recording messages to remember and do; the need to visit places and a list of other chores. The to-do list should replace random pieces of paper that are easily lost. Furthermore, it offloads your working memory because you won't need to memorize things. You enter absolutely all tasks you need to do into the to-do list. Even very short ones. Even those you easily remember. Everything. There is no task we couldn't forget.
2. **The Calendar** — here you record all your meetings and events tied to a specific day and time (doctor's appointment, meeting with friends, etc.).

**Smartphone or Paper? Choose what is familiar!**

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 007

---

**Rules for Calendar and To-Do List**

1. The calendar and to-do list replace all scraps of paper.
2. Messages, tasks from WhatsApp, conversations, or other places are entered into the to-do list.
3. All appointments are recorded in the calendar.
4. All plans and chores go into the to-do list.
5. Do not get hung up on trying to get a perfect system.
6. Get something that will always be at hand.
7. If you work poorly with computers/gadgets (get stuck in them, for example), do not try to use them for planning.

**Potential Pitfalls**

Learning any new skill requires practice and time. You may not be used to writing down everything you need to remember or carrying a calendar with you. Be aware of thoughts that might sabotage your success in the future:

- "I don't have room in my bag for a calendar."
- "It's troublesome and inconvenient to carry a notebook everywhere."
- "I've never been an organized person, so why start now?"
- "If I write down my tasks, I'll stop being responsible for them."

These thoughts are absolutely normal. The brain does not like changes and tries to protect you from them. Try to focus on the reasons why you started this program. On the goals you hope to achieve, and the achievements you will feel by taking positive steps in your life.

**Homework:**

- Get a calendar.
- Write down all chores, meetings, and tasks that need to be done on a specific day and time in it.
- Get a to-do list.
- Write down all tasks you keep in your head, on scraps of paper, in different notebooks, and on wall boards into the to-do list.
- During the week, keep the to-do list with you, write down all "incoming" tasks there. Enter all new meetings into the calendar.
- Choose a time of day when you will review the to-do list and select tasks for today.
- Bring the calendar and task list to the next meeting.

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 008

## SESSION 3

### PRIORITIZATION. PROS AND CONS. STOP.

In the last meeting, we implemented the following tools for organization and planning: calendar and to-do list. Remember that having a good calendar and to-do list system is necessary (but not sufficient) for organization. If you haven't yet started a calendar and to-do list (in any form), you need to do so as soon as possible. Be sure to schedule for yourself where and how you will use them. EVERY DAY!

- Where will you keep the to-do list?
- How will you remind yourself to use it every day?
- How will you remind yourself to look at your calendar every day?

**"Pros" and "Cons" of Using a Calendar and Task List** Since motivation is very important in any endeavor, the following exercise will help you decide exactly how this training will be useful to you, and help you stick it out to the end. This exercise is good to do again and again as you progress through the training. During the training, you will try new things, and sometimes relearn strategies you have already tried in the past. At least for a while, you will need to leave your natural comfort zone and try everything in a new way. It will be useful to realize the natural difficulties you will encounter on the path of change, as well as the potential benefits.

For example, when we master a new organizational system, you might think: "I hate keeping to-do lists. I've already had ten of them, and it didn't help: I just filled page after page of fifteen to-do lists that I didn't do." Accordingly, one of the "cons" of trying a to-do list is that you face old thoughts and old memories of how a to-do list might not work. On the other hand, it is quite possible that keeping a to-do list will help you. Thus, a "pro" for keeping a to-do list might be some important functions that will help lead to success. For example, a "pro" might be "I won't be anxious that I forgot something." List some pros and cons in your workbook.

**New Skill: Prioritization**

People with ADHD often find it difficult to decide which task is the most important. And even if you have chosen the Most Important Task, it can be difficult for you to see it through to the end. The following technique is one example of how you can force yourself to organize tasks, even if you have ADHD and it seems difficult for you. When you face multiple tasks, it is important to have one clear strategy for prioritizing. It is important to know exactly which tasks are the most important so you can be confident and calm that you will do the main thing. The best way we know is to rate each task.

We often see that people like to perform easier tasks first (even if they are less important). This can cause problems. When we complete an easy task, we feel like we have achieved something, done something, and get false satisfaction. But in this way, we may never make progress in our important affairs.

**Ranking A, B, C.**Use "A", "B", and "C" grades to make a to-do list for the day.

1. **One "A" Task** — the most important. A task that must be done today.
2. **Two "B" Tasks** — these are tasks of lesser importance. It is important to do them today, maximum tomorrow.
3. **Three "C" Tasks** — tasks of least importance. It is important to do them, but after tasks A and B. They may be more attractive and easier to perform, but not as important as tasks A and B.

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 010

---

**How to use this technique.**When compiling a to-do list for the day, you must assign each task a rating of "A", "B", or "C". You must do task "A" before you start tasks "B". And all "B" tasks before you start "C" tasks. If you have completed A, B, and C, but still have energy and opportunities for other things, make a list of new tasks A, B, C for the rest of the day. Act on the same principle.

This might be difficult for you, but it is very important! This way you will be sure that you really did everything important! Use this technique every day. If you write in a notebook, make a new list when the old one becomes too cluttered. You should easily navigate the list.

You may feel that we are asking you to do too much. Do not get upset! Some time must pass before skills become habits. As you get used to writing down your to-do list, you will learn more and more about how much you can really do in a day. If you find that you are not finishing all items on the list in a day, simply re-evaluate the task list tomorrow.

In the following sections, we will learn what to do about the fact that you repeatedly do not finish the most important things on your list. Remember that for now, you are just trying to get used to using the task list.

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 011

**STOP Skill for Switching Attention.**

**When to apply:**

- When your attention is scattered
- When you cannot really start a task, are fussing, anxious
- When you are too involved in something, and it hinders you

| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **S (Stop)** | Just don't react. Stop! Freeze! Don't move! Emotions may try to make you act without thinking. Maintain control. |
| **T (Take a step back)** | Take a "step back" from the situation. Take a break. Let go of the situation. Take a deep breath in and out. Do not let your feelings make you act impulsively. |
| **O (Observe)** | Observe what is happening inside you and outside. What is the situation? What are you thinking and feeling? What are others saying or doing? |
| **P (Proceed mindfully)** | Act consciously. Before deciding what to do, consider your thoughts and feelings, the situation, and other people's thoughts and feelings. Think about your goals. Ask yourself: What actions can improve or worsen the situation? |

**Homework**

- Enter chores into the calendar and to-do list.
- Every day form a to-do list and highlight tasks A, B, and C.
- Practice doing all A tasks before B, and all B tasks before C.
- Write about your progress/regression in the chat.

## SESSION 4

### PROBLEM SOLVING AND MANAGING OVERWHELMING TASKS

**Discussion of Home Practice**

1. Calendar for managing appointments
2. Notebook for recording to-do list
3. Using priority ratings "A", "B", and "C"

In this section, we will learn to recognize those moments when you are having difficulty completing a task, become overwhelmed, or cannot understand exactly where to start. The reason we call problems "problems" is that these tasks have no simple solution. Usually, any solution has noticeable pros and cons. It is precisely the pros and cons of any decision that can lead to delay and procrastination (we cannot choose a more suitable solution and waver). Once you understand that this task is a problem, you can use the skills below to solve it.

**We will look at two skills that may seem simple, but are actually quite powerful (if used):**

1. Choosing a plan of action
2. Breaking an overwhelming task into manageable steps

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 013

---

**Skill: Overwhelming Tasks: Breaking Tasks into Steps.**

If a task seems huge, complex, or just not very clear to us, we are much more likely to procrastinate and not even try to start working on it. Even if we know what needs to be done, it seems easier to put off work on a too-difficult task. By learning to break large tasks into smaller, manageable steps, you are more likely to start (and eventually complete) important tasks.

**Research:** If people are asked to break any task into stages, they distinguish from 3 to 10 stages. Regardless of the size of the task (cleaning the bathroom or running for president). **Conclusion:** as a result, the steps usually turn out to be too big. In this case, each step is already an overwhelming task.

**Research:** If people are promised a small win, they rejoice at a larger win. If people are promised a large win, they are unhappy with a small one. **Conclusion:** if we plan steps that are too big, we become more and more dissatisfied with the results of our activities. In daily planning, it is important to keep focus on performing small daily steps.

**Steps for Breaking Large Tasks into Manageable Steps**

1. Select a difficult or complex task from the to-do list.
2. Identify the first step. Ask yourself "what needs to be done first to make this happen?"
3. Make sure it is manageable. Ask yourself "is it realistic to complete in one day?" and "do I want to put off this step?". If the step itself is overwhelming, then break this step into smaller steps. Do not be afraid to make more steps.
4. Ask yourself "is it realistic to complete in one day?" and "do I want to put off this step?". If the step itself is overwhelming, then break this step into smaller steps. Do not be afraid to make more steps.
5. Describe the next obvious steps (no more than three).
6. For each step, make sure it is manageable. If necessary, break them down into steps again.
7. List each individual step in your to-do list.

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 014

---

**Skill: Choosing a Suitable Solution When No Solution is Perfect**

This is useful when it is difficult to find a solution, or when the number of possible solutions becomes huge.

**Five Steps in Problem Solving:**

1. **Formulate the problem.** Try to describe the problem as briefly as possible: one to two sentences. For example: "I can't decide whether to quit or not" or "I can't decide what to do with a subordinate I can't stand."
2. **List all possible solutions.** Try to write as many different solutions as possible, regardless of how realistic they are, what the consequences might be, or how unacceptable they sound to you. The idea is to write as many solutions as possible.
3. **List the pros and cons of each solution.** Realistically evaluate each solution. Describe what you think will happen if you choose this solution. Make a list of pros (advantages) and cons (disadvantages) of each. Consider both short-term and long-term consequences!
4. **Rate each solution.** Rate the pros and cons of each solution on a scale of 1 to 10. Try to be as objective as possible, but consider the relative difficulty of this decision for you. For example, if one of the solutions is to decisively say "no" to something, you must consider how much anxiety this will cause, as well as whether this decision will have the desired result.
5. **Implement the optimal option.** Now that you have rated each option on a scale of 1 to 10, calculate the final scores for each. Consider the solution with the highest score. Think about whether this is really the solution you would like to choose. If so, use other skills from this program (problem solving, organization, to-do list, calendar) to implement it.

**Homework**

1. Continue to keep the calendar, to-do list, and set priorities.
2. In writing, finish dividing a large task into steps. Enter steps into the calendar/to-do list.
3. In writing, finish choosing an action plan. Choose one solution. Enter it into the calendar/to-do list.
	- **Bold step:** take one step from the planned ones.

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 015

## SESSION 5

### REST TIME. SWITCHING ATTENTION.

**Discussion of Home Practice**

1. Calendar for managing appointments
2. General to-do list
3. To-do list for the day and use of priority ratings "A", "B", and "C"
4. "STOP", "Pros and Cons" skills
5. Breaking tasks into steps
6. Choosing a solution when none is perfect

**Necessity and Difficulties in Planning Rest if You Have ADHD** Resting state mode (Default Mode Network) is a functional network of brain activity that activates when we are not solving any tasks. The "doing nothing" network.**Functions:**

- Integration of knowledge about oneself
- Understanding other people's thoughts, their state
- Autobiographical memory, linking scattered ideas about oneself into a holistic identity
- Awareness of one's emotional state
- Mindfulness and self-esteem
- Memory (recalling)

If we are constantly in task-solving mode, the resting state mode is not activated, and these functions are not performed. We stop understanding why we are doing certain things, stop realizing our values and our state. Activity becomes chaotic, undirected. The risk of burnout increases. In a mode of constant activity, sleep suffers, the nervous system and the body do not recover. Disturbed sleep, fatigue, chaotic activity make us vulnerable, cause emotional dysregulation.

People with ADHD have impaired switching from one mode to another. It is necessary to plan rest intentionally, since starting to rest spontaneously is very difficult.

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 016

---

**Why is it hard for people with ADHD to rest?**We have a cognitive control network (Task Positive Network) and a resting state network (Default Mode Network). Between them stands the spontaneous attention switching network, which is impaired in ADHD. Because of this, when resting, a person experiences:

- Subjective feeling of anxiety
- Physiological arousal
- Guilt for undone deeds
- Constant distractibility by something
- Resting is boring. Resting can be harder than doing something. Sometimes physically unbearable. But necessary.

**Rest is any activity whose goal is the restoration and accumulation of strength and energy.** Not development! Not improvement! Not "finishing work that wasn't finished at work"! Restoration and accumulation of strength and energy.

**Examples of rest:**

1. Reading;
2. Time in nature;
3. Being alone;
4. Music;
5. Doing nothing at all;
6. Walking;
7. Hot bath;
8. Dreams and fantasies;
9. TV;
10. Mindfulness practices.

Not all of this may be rest for you, even if it looks like it in form. Pay attention to this.

**Our new mantras:**

- Rest is necessary. Without it, we face exhaustion, burnout, etc.
- Rest time must be planned (every day, week, etc.).
- You need to rest BEFORE you burn out (later is too late).
- It is necessary to intentionally stop hyperfocus.

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 017

---

**Skills for Reducing Arousal and Stopping Hyperfocus**

It is impossible to do something when you are running on the ceiling in agitation. People with ADHD often do not know how to calm down. Yet many important things in our life require activation of the parasympathetic system and reduction of arousal:

- Rest, recuperation, entertainment
- Intimacy, communication
- Work, doing something specific.

If we do not stop hyperfocus and do not reduce arousal, this causes a pseudo-bipolar cycle in ADHD:

1. Good feeling — I work a lot and with enthusiasm, do a bunch of things
2. Overexcited, so I can't stop
3. Miss the moment when I needed to rest
4. Exhaustion
5. "Depressive" cycle: apathy, depression, "cotton wool in the head," can't do anything
6. When a good feeling appears, I rejoice in it and use it to the fullest (after all, it will end soon!). Work capacity is unstable and often unpredictable, "depressive" cycles can knock us out for a long time.

Therefore, it is extremely important to learn to notice signs of overexcitement! **By what signs can you understand that you are in a "high" phase and it is time to apply inhibition skills?**

- I am productive, can handle anything
- Cannot stop, work longer than planned
- Do everything very quickly, rush
- Irritability
- After work, cannot tear myself away from it, continue to edit documents, check Telegram chats, etc.
- Sitting at the laptop after 20:00
- Pressure in the head in the forehead and temples
- Other

Think about by what signs you personally can understand that it is time to apply arousal reduction skills (sensations in the body, thoughts, emotions, urges, actions)?

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 018

---

**Self-Soothing**

It is impossible to calm down while you continue to do what excites the nervous system! Use 5 senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste) to trigger the parasympathetic system and, as a result, reduce arousal.

Start a box or a place where things will be collected that will help you reduce arousal and bring pleasant experiences: photos of loved ones/pets, a soft blanket, old seasons of your favorite series, a notebook with pencils, a book, an eye mask and headphones, anti-stress toys, aromatic oils, candles, favorite candies, etc. It is important that you know that these things will always wait for you in one place, and you can always return to them. This technique can be applied anywhere, wherever you are, even if you are far from your self-soothing box and your favorite items are not at hand. Simply focus on different senses to return yourself to the present moment and switch attention:

**5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1** **GROUNDING TECHNIQUE** A calming technique that connects you to the present by exploring five senses.

- **5** things you can see
- **4** things you can touch
- **3** things you can hear
- **2** things you can smell
- **1** thing you can taste

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 019

---

**Skill "Drop the Anchor"**

**When to apply:**

- When you are overwhelmed by any emotions, physical arousal, thoughts
- When your attention is narrowed and you cannot focus on what is important to do now
- When it seems to you that you are managing yourself poorly

**Dropping the anchor is useful for:**

- Stopping rumination
- Stopping hyperfocus and switching to another activity
- Focusing your attention on the task (stopping procrastination, impulse to start activity)
- Breaking the cycle of impulsive, compulsive, aggressive, addictive, or self-harming behavior

This technique does not require you to say anything, or talk to yourself, so you can do it even when knocked off your feet by emotions. The basis of this technique is the metaphor of an anchor that we drop when we are in an emotional storm. Dropping the anchor will not help the storm stop; it will only keep you steady until the storm passes. The storm may stop quickly, or not soon, or even get worse before it gets better. The anchor will hold you during this time so the storm cannot carry you away (and you don't do stupid things).

**The exercise is based on three sets of instructions:**

1. **Awareness of the internal storm/arousal/emotional pain.**
2. **Awareness of the present moment:** be aware of the presence of difficult thoughts and feelings and at the same time notice what you feel, see, hear, inhale, touch (use 5 senses to return to the present moment). This does NOT mean distracting yourself from pain; but it means noticing that simultaneously with this pain something else is happening now. That this moment is significantly larger than just difficult thoughts and feelings, although they dominate your consciousness now.
3. **Manifestation of self-control over physical actions:** move, stretch, change posture, sit up straight, stand up, take a walk, sit down, breathe, breathe differently, press feet on the floor, press hands on the chair, squeeze fingers together, drink water, hug yourself, massage, etc.

**Detailed Instruction:**If you have the opportunity, sit so that you are comfortable.

1. **Turn your attention inward and notice the storm that is there.**Pay attention — are these emotions, thoughts, physical sensations, or something else? Notice how this storm feels inside you.
	- Press your feet firmly into the floor
	- Sit straight and straighten your back
	- Squeeze your fingertips together, move your elbows, move your shoulders.
	- Feel the movement of your arms from fingers to shoulder blades
2. **Again pay attention to the storm that is inside you.**Around this storm there is a body that you can move and control. Now just pay attention to your whole body — arms, legs, back.... Stretch a little.... Relax your legs
	- Now look around you and notice any 5 objects
	- Pay attention to 3 or 4 sounds you can hear
	- If you can, look out the window or into the distance, notice what is there. Think about the fact that it was there before you saw it
3. **And again pay attention to that very painful thing you are struggling with... And notice that besides this pain, there is something around you:**
	- Pay attention to your body in the chair... move it... stretch a little... take control of your arms and legs
	- Pay attention to the room around you
	- Look around you or out the window.

**After the exercise:**

- Did you notice any difference? Are you less immersed in the emotional storm (or "these difficult thoughts and feelings")?
- Are you less "swept away" or "captured" by it/them?
- Is it easier for you to interact with people, be present here, focus?
- Do you possess more control over your actions — over arms, legs, and mouth?
- How can this small exercise be useful to you?
- Do you have the willingness to use it?

**Important:** we are not trying to remove the storm or reduce it, that is not the point of the exercise. The point is to gain control over your behavior and contact with reality. If you are doing this practice at work, driving, etc., you can change it as you wish: perform any actions with the body (squeeze the steering wheel, imperceptibly press feet on the floor, move shoulders — any action that is appropriate) and observe reality around (people, their appearance, surroundings, sounds, etc.)

## SESSION 6

### FOCUS MANAGEMENT

**What we have already studied:**

1. Calendar for meetings
2. General to-do list
3. To-do list for the day and use of priority ratings "A", "B", and "C"
4. "STOP", "Pros and Cons" skills
5. Breaking tasks into steps
6. Choosing a solution when none is perfect
7. Planning rest
8. Reducing arousal, self-soothing, dropping anchor, ice, breathing, willingness and half-smile

**Reducing Arousal + Willingness**

Another option for self-soothing through the body is breathing. **How it works:**During inhalation, the heart rate accelerates, and during exhalation, it slows down. This happens under the influence of activation of the sympathetic (responsible for arousal) part of the nervous system on inhalation and parasympathetic (responsible for relaxation) on exhalation. If we slow down breathing to 5-6 cycles per minute and/or make the exhalation longer than the inhalation, we can soothe the nervous system using the body.

There are different breathing practices. For example, **square breathing**. It is called so because all its phases are performed for a certain equal count, which resembles the sides of a square. We inhale for a count of four, hold our breath for a count of four, exhale for a count of four, and hold it again for a count of four. Or **breathing for a different count**. For example, inhale for 4 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds. There are really many breathing techniques. Find what suits you best. You can use visualizations from the folder with materials for this lesson.

Think about which method you like best and when will you apply breathing techniques in life?

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 022

---

**Willingness and Half-Smile.**

**These skills can be applied at moments when you:**

- try to deny reality and resist it;
- control what cannot be controlled;
- experience passivity when active actions are required;
- feel anger and suffering regarding chores.

**Willingness** is the acceptance of reality coupled with the desire and ability to act effectively in current circumstances. It means doing what works, being open to life, and building and living a life worth living, despite the fact that it contains pain and constant variability.

For example, you need to work during the holidays. **It will be ineffective to:**

- put off work,
- be angry that this needs to be done,
- ditch everything and party.

Then we practice willingness and half-smile as an alternative and focus on what is important.

**So, what to do:**

1. Feel the support under your feet, breathing somewhere in the body. Observe how you inhale and exhale.
2. Relax the muscles of the face, starting from the forehead and gradually moving lower, relaxing eye muscles, cheeks, jaw. After the face is relaxed — gently lift the corners of the lips up. Important — this half-smile is addressed to you, not outwardly. It is a support for you in the situation where you chose to help yourself gain stability.
3. Allow your hands to gently fall on your knees palms up (if you are sitting) or place your hands along your body, pointing thumbs in different directions, opening palms. Relaxed palms are the opposite body reaction to the anger reaction (hands, in this case, are usually tense).

**Attention Management Skill**

ADHD patients usually say that it is incredibly difficult for them to do one thing because they are hindered by other tasks (less important now), ideas, thoughts, and other distractions. Shortened attention span is a distinctive feature of ADHD. It does not mean that people with ADHD have lower intelligence or fewer abilities. It is just our distinctive feature, and we must intentionally use additional skills to cope with it. There are many examples of people doing incredible things despite their limitations. Take Stevie Wonder, who became a star despite his blindness. The goal of therapy is to help you live and function at an optimal level. We will use several strategies to help you achieve this goal.

**What to do:**

- First, evaluate: for how long can you already perform a boring or unattractive task without stopping.
- Next, use the problem-solving skills you learned earlier to break the task into stages that last this length of time. For example, if you can definitely work on a boring task for 10 minutes, break a large task (e.g., paying bills) into 10-minute chunks.

Over the next week, choose a task you avoided doing (review your task lists). Find a stopwatch. Any that is convenient for you: a wristwatch that has several fixed alarm periods, a stopwatch, and a timer. You can use a kitchen timer, online timer, smartphone, or any other type of timer that will allow you to track how long you can hold attention on one task.

**Find out how much time you can work on a task that seems boring or difficult to you, or which you avoided before:**

1. Get a stopwatch or clock recording start and end times.
2. Start working.
3. Continue working until you usually take a break, go to the toilet, or get distracted by another task.
4. When a strong desire to stop work comes, press the stopwatch and see how long you were able to work. Record the time.

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 024

---

**Timing for Attention Management:**

1. Use the problem-solving skills you know to break overwhelming or boring tasks into chunks of approximately the duration you can already maintain your attention.
2. We advise taking small breaks between parts. As you do this more and more, you can gradually increase the duration of attention concentration using skills from the next section.
3. Try making short intervals (5 minutes) between three consecutive periods, then take a longer rest interval. Or perform another task (but also from the important list) as rest.

**Delaying Distractibility**

When you are working on a boring task, distractions will inevitably appear in your head and tempt you. Many of these distracting things may seem more important to you than they really are. The question here is: are these distractions really important or do they seem more important because:

- This is not the task that really needs to be done
- The task you really need to do is currently uninteresting, boring, or unpleasant.

Is this really important, or just more attractive? Example — one patient working on a master's thesis. Every time he sat down to write the thesis, he felt the need to clean the apartment. He didn't want to clean before, but now he wants to clean every time he sits down for the thesis. Eventually, he reached a point where he simply couldn't work unless everything in his apartment was cleaned! Perhaps the cleanest apartments in the world belong to graduate students who need to write their dissertations! In these cases, cleaning becomes a distraction that becomes more and more important over time. Even if it wasn't the most important or interesting task, it becomes much more attractive than the actual overwhelming or boring task.

**Delaying Distractibility** is an exercise worth doing in addition to what we described earlier. This is the same technique used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, etc. After you have timed how long you can maintain your attention, and broken tasks into steps that take about that long, try to learn to **delay distractibility**.

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 025

---

**Steps for Delaying Distractibility**

1. Place a notebook or sheet of paper next to you.
2. Set a timer for a certain time (as much as you can already study, or slightly more).
3. Start working on the task.
4. When a distracting thought appears in your head, write it down in your notebook, but do nothing about it (e.g., do not get up, do not call anyone, do not start washing dishes or paying a bill).
5. As soon as you write it down, tell yourself something like "I'll deal with this later," "This is not the most important thing right now," "I'll come back to this," etc.
6. Return to the original task until you complete the set piece of work.
7. When you are done with work for the day, return to the "distraction list." Decide if these are really important tasks, or if they became attractive only because you weren't supposed to do them right today.
8. If they are really important, complete them or add them to the task list.

**New Arousal Reduction and Attention Switching Skill: Using Cold Water.**

You can change your face temperature using cold water to calm down quickly.

- **Precautions:** Very cold water reduces your heart rate. If you have heart disease or take medications that cause a lower heart rate (e.g., beta-blockers), consult your doctor before using these skills. Avoid ice water if you are allergic to cold.

When you dip your whole face into cold water... or place a cloth soaked in cold water (or a bag of water) on your eyes and cheeks and hold your breath, temperature receptors in the facial skin tell your brain you are diving underwater. This triggers a "diving response" in return (it may take 15-30 seconds to start). Your heart rate slows down, blood flow to "non-essential" organs decreases and redirects to the brain and heart. This reaction can quickly help you regulate emotions. This will be useful as a crisis survival strategy when you have strong negative emotions, or when a very strong urge for ineffective behavior arises, or when your nervous system is overexcited and needs to be calmed.

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 026

---

**There are several possible options for practicing this skill:**

- **Use a basin of cold water.** Lean over, hold your breath, and immerse your face (up to the temples) in a basin of cold water for 30-60 seconds or until you feel discomfort. This is usually enough to trigger the diving reflex. The colder the water and the longer the immersion, the more pronounced it is. But be careful! Do not use water that is too cold. Water below 10 degrees Celsius can cause facial pain during immersion.
- **Use an ice pack or cold compress.** Sit on a chair and apply an ice pack (wrapped in a towel, of course) or a cold compress to the eye and cheekbone area. Wet the side of the compress that touches your face. If you stand up, lean over, and hold your breath while doing this, the effect will intensify.
- **Splash cold water on your face.** Even splashing cold water on your eyes and cheeks might be enough, but to make the reflex work even better, stand up, lean over, and hold your breath.

This skill, by the way, can be useful not only for reducing the severity of emotional reactions but also if you cannot fall asleep due to anxiety or intrusive worries. However, its use is not recommended for people with heart problems; in this case, it is possible only with a doctor's permission.

**Homework**

1. **Use skills from past weeks:**
	- Calendar and to-do list
	- Priorities "A", "B", "C"
	- Choosing a solution for ambiguous tasks
	- Dividing a large task into separate steps
	- Rest, reducing arousal
2. **Use Delaying Distractibility skills every day.**
3. **Find out your concentration period** and practice breaking a long task into chunks equal to this time.
4. **Try breathing techniques, willingness, and using cold** to calm down / switch attention.

## SESSION 7

### ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFICATION

**What we have already studied:**

1. Calendar for meetings
2. General to-do list
3. To-do list for the day and use of priority ratings "A", "B", and "C"
4. "STOP", "Pros and Cons" skills
5. Breaking tasks into steps
6. Choosing a solution when none is perfect
7. Planning rest
8. Reducing arousal, self-soothing, dropping anchor, ice, breathing, willingness and half-smile
9. Effective timing
10. Delaying distractibility — practice today

The main goals of this meeting are to learn to modify the space around you to reduce distractibility and learn to create reminders to focus on the current task. For people with ADHD, it is important to work in a space where there are few distractions. Even with the distraction reduction skills we already discussed, most people often get distracted when trying to concentrate. Sometimes distractions interfere to such an extent that it becomes impossible to work.

Think about the place where you try to work, study, and do other important things. Ask yourself "what usually distracts me from work?" Some typical distractions:

- Phone calls
- Surfing the internet, online communication, online games
- Notifications on the phone
- Replying to email and messages
- You notice things on the table
- Listening to something on the radio or another sound source
- Watching something on TV
- Conversations with someone in the same room as you
- Looking out the window
- Thoughts, ideas, memories, impulses in the head

For each item that distracts you, you need to come up with a strategy that will reduce your susceptibility to distraction.

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 028

---

**For example, you can:**

- Turn off the phone
- Close the web browser or email
- Turn off the message notification signal
- Put on headphones and turn on background music
- Clear your desk
- Turn off the radio and TV
- Ask others not to disturb you
- Move your desk away from the window
- Write down all impulses and ideas on paper instead of executing them immediately

**Location, Location, Location!**We advise finding one place in your home where you can perform important tasks without distraction. This could be your desk, chair, or any other workspace. Many people say their desk becomes cluttered with things. Of course, it is difficult to keep a desk clean (use your document system!). However, if you think you cannot keep your desk clean, find another place that is easier to keep clean and make it your workspace.

**Skill: Keeping Track of Important Things** A characteristic feature of people with ADHD is that people with this syndrome often lose important things. This creates problems, lateness, and feelings of frustration. At this stage, think about any difficulties you face with important things: keys, wallet, phone charger, notebook. Some of them you need to take with you when you leave the house. The next step is to come up with a specific place where you will keep these things. Some people put a basket near the door and put these things there every time they come home. It could be a key cabinet or hooks on the wall. You can place all important things in one place, or you will need to come up with several different places. If things have their place, they will be easier to find. But you need to work to develop a habit: never put keys in a place other than their own place. Never! You are more likely to succeed if you involve all family members in this. Tell everyone in the family where the place for things is and ask them to either put things there or remind you if they notice something is wrong (and you must promise not to get angry at them when they remind you!). Another important (much more difficult) task: every time you see these things not in their place, immediately return them to their place.

## SESSION 8

### APPLYING SKILLS TO PROCRASTINATION

**Review of Previous Skills**

1. **Organization and Planning Skills**
	- Calendar and to-do list
	- Using priority ratings "A", "B", "C"
	- Pros and Cons
	- Breaking tasks into manageable steps
	- Choosing a solution if none is perfect
	- Planning rest
2. **Attention Management Skills**
	- Reducing arousal (self-soothing kit, ice — cold water, breathing)
	- STOP skills, dropping anchor, willingness and half-smile
	- Timing: measuring one's attention concentration time and working in such intervals
	- Delaying distractibility: Genius Thoughts Paper (distraction list)
	- Environmental management: dealing with distractions, setting up one workspace
	- Place for important things, storage system
	- Reminders and timer

**Review of the Procrastination Problem**

Procrastination can cause anxiety and depression, but for a number of reasons, putting things off sometimes seems more attractive than doing them now. We understand procrastination as avoidance behavior: we want to avoid unpleasant experiences. This is an important detail regarding why we put things off.

**Read the reasons for procrastination below and check those characteristic of you**

- Task is not written in the to-do list
- Overwhelming, too scary and difficult task
- Unclear where to start
- Internal resistance
- Perfectionism, or fear of negative evaluation if you do less-than-perfectly
- Unattractive tasks that require effort
- Difficulty starting a new task under time constraints
- Negative thoughts like "Nothing will work out anyway," "I'm just that kind of person," etc.
- Thought that you need to wait for the right time/state/mood, or the moment when "there will be time" (usually this moment does not come)
- Other reasons

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 030

---

**Consequences of Procrastination**

Procrastination can help us avoid unpleasant experiences or regulate our attention. Unfortunately, there are negative consequences of procrastination that outweigh its benefits. **Read the negative consequences of procrastination, mark those existing for you:**

- Stress the whole time we are waiting for the "last minute"
- A task that is unattractive at first glance seems even worse to us when it hangs over us all day (week, month, year). If we wait until the last minute, we will have to sacrifice all other chores when the deadline comes to perform it.
- The task becomes the "executioner" of all other activities, and we begin to relate to it even worse.
- High risk of not making the deadline
- Start thinking worse and worse about ourselves over time
- Result is often worse than it could be
- Ignoring the problem usually complicates the situation, and it becomes increasingly difficult to solve
- Other negative consequences

**Skill: Applying "PROS" and "CONS" to Procrastination**

At the beginning of this course, you used a "PROS" and "CONS" sheet to evaluate the pros and cons of learning new skills. This same method is useful for understanding the consequences of delay. It is usually difficult to remember the pros and cons at the moment when an "insurmountable" task stands before you. Taking a time-out and evaluating the pros and cons of delaying can be a useful exercise to start the task.

**Form "Pros and Cons of Delaying a Task"**

|  | PROS (benefits, gains) | CONS (minuses, losses) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Procrastinate** | Short-term:      Long-term: | Short-term:      Long-term: |
| **Apply skills and start the task** | Short-term:      Long-term: | Short-term:      Long-term: |

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 031

---

**Skill: Applying Problem Solving Skills to Procrastination**

Earlier in the course, you studied problem-solving skills. When a task seems too complicated to you, or you are not sure where to start, you will likely put off its execution. In this case, we advise breaking the task into small steps (see next page). Remember that each step should seem quite doable. If this is not the case, break this step into even smaller steps. Alternatively, instead of trying to work on the entire problem, you can choose just one or two goals from it. Another mistake is setting unrealistic goals. Remember: every step you take must be realistic. Also, delaying distractibility skills will be useful to you. If you know that your attention span for unpleasant tasks is 15 minutes, then break each step into goals that can be completed in 15 minutes. Another possible problem is you don't know what to do. Then before doing something, you need to choose an action plan. Return to the problem-solving worksheets from previous modules.

**Problem Solving Form: Choosing an Action Plan**

1. Describe the problem. List all possible solutions you can think of.
2. Write them down, even if you think they make no sense or you are not sure you can fulfill them. Come up with as many solutions as possible.
3. List the pros and cons of each solution.
4. Rate every plus and minus for each solution. Then review the entire list and calculate the score for each solution.

| Possible solution path | PROS | CONS | Total solution score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |

**Hosts:** Tatyana Volkova, Daria Sinitsina. YouTube "Double ADHD": `https://youtube.com/@doubleADHD` 032

---

**Task Breakdown Form (continued from prev. page)**

1. Select a difficult or complex task from the to-do list.
2. List the steps that need to be completed. Ask yourself "what needs to be done first to make this happen?" Write down those steps that are obvious.
3. For each step, make sure it is manageable. Ask yourself "is it realistic to complete in one day?" and "do I want to put off this step?". If the step itself is overwhelming, then break this step into smaller steps.
4. List each individual step in your daily to-do list. If there are too many of them, or it is difficult to plan all stages, write down the first 1-3 stages. You will finish writing the rest later.

**Environmental Management Skills**

It may be that it is difficult for you to take the necessary steps because NOT doing this task is easier than doing it. In this case, environmental management will help you. You can change your environment so that doing this task becomes easier.

- For example, you can collect all documents for work in one folder and put it on the desktop.
- Or put the book you want to read on the bedside table and set a reminder in your phone for 21:45 "Read 10 pages of the book."
- Or you can pack your gym uniform and put the ready bag in the hallway.
- Or you can put a plate of fruit on the table — so it will be easier for you to eat them.
- Or you can ask someone to do it.

What task have I been putting off for a long time? What can I change in the environment around me to make this task a little easier to do?

**Potential Difficulties**

Perhaps you have been struggling with procrastination for many years and have come to consider it part of your nature. Maybe you no longer believe that anything will help. These thoughts can make you not even try to use these skills! Even if you are not sure, conduct an experiment. For one week, use these skills every day, and see how much what you do improves. Most likely, you will quickly see results, and then it will be easier for you to practice your new methods.

**Safety Plan After Training**

After the end of the training, there is a very high probability that sooner or later, for various reasons, you will stop applying the skills. This is normal, it happens to almost all people with ADHD. Think about what consequences this will lead to? The good news is that you can notice this and resume skills. To do this, answer two questions:

- By what signs will I understand that it is time to resume skills?
- Where will I start resuming skills?
1. **Organization and Planning Skills**
	- Calendar and to-do list
	- Using priority ratings "A", "B", "C"
	- Pros and Cons
	- Breaking tasks into manageable steps
	- Choosing a solution if none is perfect
	- Planning rest
2. **Attention Management Skills**
	- Reducing arousal (self-soothing kit, ice — cold water, breathing)
	- STOP skills, dropping anchor, willingness and half-smile
	- Timing: measuring one's attention concentration time and working in such intervals
	- Delaying distractibility: Genius Thoughts Paper (distraction list)
	- Environmental management: dealing with distractions, setting up one workspace
	- Place for important things, storage system
	- Stickers and timer
3. **Other:**
	- Write (to whom?)
	- Read (what?)
	- Do (what?)

What documents/memos/phones will I need to return to skills? Where will I keep them?

Good luck to you!
